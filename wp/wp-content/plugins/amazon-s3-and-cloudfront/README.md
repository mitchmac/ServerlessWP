## Description

FORMERLY WP OFFLOAD S3 LITE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-wTMXMeFu4

This plugin automatically copies images, videos, documents, and any other media added through WordPress' media uploader to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) or [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). It then automatically replaces the URL to each media file with their respective Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces or Google Cloud Storage URL or, if you have configured [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) or another CDN with or without a custom domain, that URL instead. Image thumbnails are also copied to the bucket and delivered through the correct remote URL.

Uploading files *directly* to your Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces or Google Cloud Storage account is not currently supported by this plugin. They are uploaded to your server first, then copied to the bucket. There is an option to automatically remove the files from your server once they are copied to the bucket however.

If you're adding this plugin to a site that's been around for a while, your existing media files will not be copied to or served from Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces or Google Cloud Storage. Only newly uploaded files will be copied to and served from the bucket. [The pro upgrade](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-media/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BOffload%2BS3&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) has an upload tool to handle existing media files.

**Image Optimization**

Although WP Offload Media doesn't include image optimization features, we work closely with the author of [EWWW Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/) to ensure they always work well together. Not only do we recommend EWWW Image Optimizer but we officially support its integration with WP Offload Media.

## Upgrade Notice

### 2.6

This is a major upgrade that updates the format of information stored about offloaded Media Library items. Once upgraded you will not be able to downgrade without restoring data from a backup.
This version requires PHP 5.6+

### 2.3

This is a major upgrade that switches to using a custom table for storing data about offloaded Media Library items. Once upgraded you will not be able to downgrade without restoring data from a backup.

### 2.0

This is a major upgrade that introduces support for DigitalOcean Spaces, renames the plugin to WP Offload Media Lite, and coincidentally upgrades some of its database settings. You may not be able to downgrade to WP Offload S3 Lite 1.x after upgrading to WP Offload Media Lite 2.0+.

### 1.1

This is a major change, which ensures S3 URLs are no longer saved in post content. Instead, local URLs are filtered on page generation and replaced with the S3 version. If you depend on the S3 URLs being stored in post content you will need to make modifications to support this version.

### 0.6

This version requires PHP 5.3.3+ and the Amazon Web Services plugin
