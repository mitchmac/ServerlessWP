			 *
			 *   1. Some special character escape sequences are recognized.
			 *      For example, "\n" is a newline character, "\0" is ASCII NULL.
			 *   2. A specific treatment is applied to "\%" and "\_" sequences.
			 *      This is due to their special meaning for pattern matching.
			 *   3. Other backslash-prefixed characters resolve to their literal
			 *      values. For example, "\x" represents "x", "\\" represents "\".
			 *
			 * Despite looking similar, these rules are different from the C-style
			 * string escaping, so we cannot use "strip(c)slashes()" in this case.
			 *
			 * See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/string-literals.html
